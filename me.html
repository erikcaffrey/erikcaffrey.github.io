<h3>Professional Career</h3>
<p>
I've worked in different roles in software since some years ago, and I still continue learning about effective software development so I'm interested in share experiences, techniques, and lessons learned, so more developers can use it in their daily work. I mainly focus on design software systems, clean code, open-source, testing strategies, agile methodologies, to contribute to improving the software industry. Recently part of the Google Developer Expert program as <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-erik_jhordan_rey">Android GDE</a> for my contributions to the android community and I currently work as an Engineering Manager at J√ºsto. Leading part of the engineering team actually we are developing all our platform (Web, Android, and iOS applications) I'm charged to develop product features and internal tools, we are in favor to develop and design high-quality software but we also experimenting strategies that provide us learnings to understand our users so we can iterate our product and give more value to the user as soon as possible.
