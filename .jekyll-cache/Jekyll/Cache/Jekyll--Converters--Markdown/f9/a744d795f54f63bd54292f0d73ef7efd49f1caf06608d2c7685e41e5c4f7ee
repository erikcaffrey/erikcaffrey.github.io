<p>Iâ€™m a person passionate to build technology products.

<h2 id="life-is-a-balance">Life is a balance</h2>

<p>I practiced multiple sports throughout my whole life so are part of my lifestyle. I love playing soccer âš½, swimming ğŸŠğŸ¼, run ğŸƒğŸ», and cycling ğŸš´ğŸ¼. Iâ€™m a member of a triathlon team <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alpuntosport/">@alpuntosport</a> and I really love training mainly long distances because It has taught me always to be prepared to front the most unthinkable and unexpected situations when all seems is over your control things happen but Iâ€™ve learned the best way to face it is by trying.</p>

<p><em>â€œLearn to domain your mind, train your physical and enjoy the competition, <strong>when your legs canâ€™t run anymore run with your heart</strong>â€</em></p>
