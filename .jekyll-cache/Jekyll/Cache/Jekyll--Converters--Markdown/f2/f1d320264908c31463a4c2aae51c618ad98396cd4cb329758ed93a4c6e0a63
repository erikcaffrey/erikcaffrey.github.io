<p><strong>This talk is about how to write software that can be maintained, verifiable, and flexible enough to adapt to growth and change following a series of patterns and guidelines that I and my team believe that can be applied to the daily work of a software developer.</strong> - <em>March 06, 2017</em></p>

<script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="83393110e62a4b33b8f94a14af309a88" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<p><strong>We know that writing quality software is hard and complex: It is not only about satisfying requirements, also should be maintainable, testable, and flexible enough to adapt to growth and change.
Clean architecture comes up and could be a good approach for using when developing any software application.</strong> - <em>February 22, 2017</em></p>

<script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="22cc72fea90043ff8b190e65d4c32a85" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<hr />

<p><strong>Dependencies coupled are dangerous because we couple both modules in a way that if we need to change one module with another, we necessarily need to modify the code of the coupled module that‚Äôs really bad if we want to create a testable app because unit testing requires that when we are testing a module, it is isolated from the rest of modules in our app. The solution is Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.</strong> - <em>November 07, 2016</em></p>
