**This talk is about how to write software that can be maintained, verifiable, and flexible enough to adapt to growth and change following a series of patterns and guidelines that I and my team believe that can be applied to the daily work of a software developer.** - *March 06, 2017*

**We know that writing quality software is hard and complex: It is not only about satisfying requirements, also should be maintainable, testable, and flexible enough to adapt to growth and change.
Clean architecture comes up and could be a good approach for using when developing any software application.** - *February 22, 2017*

***

**Dependencies coupled are dangerous because we couple both modules in a way that if we need to change one module with another, we necessarily need to modify the code of the coupled module that‚Äôs really bad if we want to create a testable app because unit testing requires that when we are testing a module, it is isolated from the rest of modules in our app. The solution is Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.** - *November 07, 2016*
