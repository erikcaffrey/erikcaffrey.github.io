## Who Am I

## Life is a balance

I'm a member of a triathlon team [@alpuntosport](https://www.instagram.com/alpuntosport/) and I really love training mainly long distances because It has taught me always to be prepared to front the most unthinkable and unexpected situations when all seems is over your control things happen but I've learned the best way to face it is by trying.

*"Learn to domain your mind, train your physical and enjoy the competition, **when your legs can't run anymore run with your heart**"*
