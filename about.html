<h2>Erik Jhordan Rey</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Erik Jhordan I’m a mobile engineer currently working at Segundamano in Mexico City basically my role is support, define, design intern libraries, training and teach architecture, refactor, clean code and testing to my mobile team (Android & IOS).</p>

<p>I consider myself a person passionate about good code, open source, good practices and software engineering my favorite part. I am a fan of technology, swimming, playing soccer and of course food, one of the most interesting things and my favorite part is to create code for developers, for that reason is why I decided to start writing on this blog, to share more content, some gist, examples, more android or iOS, software engineering or just something interesting and great that can be very useful.</p>
