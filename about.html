<h3>Hi, I am <span>Erik</span></h3>
<p>I currently work as Team Lead and Mobile Software Engineer at Segundamano Â· Adevinta leading a two engineering teams (mobile team and a multifunctional team) focused to develop & design high-quality (modularized, testable, maintainable) software, we are really interested in continuous self-learning, team-learning, and share knowledge with the community but my most matter task is to help my team to be better persons and engineers looking opportunities for they can do it and grow their professional careers. I consider myself a person passionate about good code, open source, good practices and software engineering my favorite part. I am a fan of technology, sports lover (I practice swimming, running, road bicycle, playing soccer and tennis), one of the most interesting things and my favorite part is to create code for developers, for that reason is why I decided to start writing on this blog to share more eperiences or just something interesting that can be very useful for other devs. Although I share mobile content I also usually share software engineering content or other technologies.
